    <h2>No difference</h2>
      <h3> by Shel Silverstein</h3>
        <p>
        Small as a peanut,
        Big as a giant,
        We're all the same size
        When we turn off the light
        Rich as a sultan,
        Poor as a mite,
        We're all worth the same
        When we turn off the light.
        Red, black or orange,
        Yellow or white,
        We all look the same
        When we turn off the light.
        So maybe the way
        To make everything right
        Is for God to just reach out
        And turn off the light!        
      </p>
